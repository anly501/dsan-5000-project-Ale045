    "section": "Background: Research Works Done in this Field",
    "text": "Background: Research Works Done in this Field\nSince the great changes in musical industry, extensive researches were done in this realm, offering us the background knowledge and valuable insights. I shall address two important publications here which provide us important background knowledge and insight on understanding today’s music trend.\n\nPublication-1: Changing Their Tune: How Consumers’ Adoption of Online Streaming Affects Music Consumption and Discovery\nThis paper throughly described how the streaming service impact the way music were consumed and user behavior. The author segment the research into three parts, first they identify the increment contribution of streaming service is contributing to the overall music consumption. Secondly, it compare the diversity in the consumers’ choice in music categories between streaming service and traditional ownership model. Finally, it researched what could impact a song’s success in the streaming environment (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018).\nTo analysis the effects of adopting streaming service on individual music consumption, they use an anonymous third party service tracking the consumer’s platform preference and their listening behavior to create a panel of data. By applying a difference in differences (DiD) method, the authors compare the consumption differences between the group of people who adopt the streaming service and people who did not. According to their findings, adopting to streaming lead to a 49% increase of music consumption across all the platform. Furthermore listeners in streaming service tend to have a wider spectrum of music choices. The author noted it is benefit to those smaller artist to get attention but it also make the situation more competitive since the listeners now tend to discover new music instead of staying still (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018).\n\n\nPublication-2: Tastes and Age: A Study of the Relationship between Music Tastes and Age Cohorts\nIn this paper, the author tried to investigate the impact of ages’ influence on individual music preference. The main object is to discover the relationship between then contemporary music taste and age age cohorts (Glevarec, Nowak, and Mahut 2020). The data they used for research is the ELIPSS inquiry from 2013 conducted by the Centre of Socio-Political Data in Pairs. This enquires include 13 genres of music and with a sample space of 892. The research methodology employed a regression analysis on the socio-demographic variables including age, education, profession, gender of a person and their taste of music genres. The finding reveal that for most music genres, age of the listener is the dominate factor to determine whether it will be appreciate or not. It is also noticed that people tend to rate the artist higher when they are at a similar age with the listener. Also, the author went further and point out it can be inferred from the research that people are likely to be linked to an artist they encountered during their teenager (Glevarec, Nowak, and Mahut 2020).\n\n\nOther Relevent Works:\nThere are many other researches dive into the topic of the contemporary music trends in many perspective to provide us the background of this project. The trend can be split into three aspect, the trend for music content, the trend in music consumption and the trend in music creation.\n\nTrend in Music Contents:\nIn terms of music content, current researches indicating the lyric of the songs are getting simpler and the songs with simple lyrics tend to be more successful (Varnum et al. 2021). Also, according to research, the lyrics now more likely to contain negative emotions (Brand, Acerbi, and Mesoudi 2019). This is important to notice since the research done by Borg and Hokkanen shows that lyrics plays an significant role in a music’s success (Borg and Hokkanen 2011). There are also new genres emerging, Base on the second publication summary above, we can observe the new Z generation is the key audience of those novice genres (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018). According to Klement & Strambach, the local and extra-local knowledge source contribute to those new genres creation (Klement and Strambach 2019).\n\n\nTrend in Music Consumption:\nThe advent of streaming services has totally revolutionized music consumption as describe in the first publication’s summary. Additionally, changes also reflect on the form music been consumed. Nowadays music is often consume in combine with video or games. An good example is the TikTok. According to study, the more interactive mode in platform like TikTok short video make people foster affliction by mixing the music with image, video and text, and it is also shown as a way to self-express and connect people with similar afflictions (Vizcaı́no-Verdú and Abidin 2022).\n\n\nTrend in Music Creation:\nThere are also revolution in music creations. With more AI assistance tools emerging, even individual without traditional musical training could create songs, however it also means the standard for hit song is increasing (Liu 2019). Also the streaming service like Spotify enable artist to upload their work without the need of signing to a label. However, these technology doesn’t always promote the creation. THOMAS HODGSON described it as ‘Creative Ambivalence’ mainly caused by the opaque nature of recommending algorithm (Hodgson 2021). Artist might spend more time to align their work to the algorithm rather than being creative (Hodgson 2021)."

We also expect to see a trend where individual artist and artists who also from Gen Z are thriving."
