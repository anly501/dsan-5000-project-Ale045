    "text": "Cleaning Spotify data of current trending songs:\n\n\nFirst I merge the data from three files (global_top_50.csv, billboard_features.csv, billboard_2022_features.csv) containing recent trending music in Spotify. Because they have the same format, I just need to combine them into a data frame.\nThere are a lot of not useful colums containing various urls as shown in the picture below. Drop the unnecessary columns like time_signature, analysis_url, track_href… to lower the data dimension. Before cleaning the columns looks like this:  After cleaning, noticed all the url columns are gone: \nCheck if there are any missing values, in this case, the dataset does not contain any, like the picture below: \nIn some case there are multipy artists for For the case where a track contain more than one artiest, just leave the prominent one to keep constant with other datasets.\nAn example of multiple artists (the red words are the artist ids): \nSince we are concern about the genre information for each song, add genre column which get data from the artist dataset, using the genre information from the artist dataset spotify_artist.csv.\nColumns after adding genre information: \n\nA sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\n\n\nsample\n\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: spotify_current_all.csv\n\n\n\nClean historical trending musics:\n\n\nFirst, I noticed the column name is too redundancy, so I changed them so they are easier to retrieve and also consistent with the previous contemporary music data.\nColumn names Before cleaning:  After cleaning: \nCheck if there are any missing values, in this case, there are no missing values \nDrop the ‘liveness’ column because it is not relevant to the music itself.\nColumns after dropping the ‘liveness’ column: \nThere are too many genres in this dataset like shown in the picture below. To make it better for analysis, I map each specific genre using regular expression and hard code mapping.\nBefore mapping:  After mapping:\n\nCreate a year binning over the year column. Make the bin width of 5 years.\nBefore binning, the year column is like this, just separate years indicate the year of the song:\n$ year        : num [1:603] 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 ... After bining, the years is turned to two groups, like shown in the picture below:\n\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset: \nLink to the cleaned dataset: top50MusicFrom2010-2019_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nClean the artist dataset:\n\n\nThere are too many not useful columns like various urls so drop them first. Also, each artist has 8 columns of genre, to keep it consistent with other datasets, drop the genre columns and only keep the priority genre. However, the priority genre is either stored in the genres1 column or the genres column, depending on how many genres the artist have, so here I only drop the genres2 to genres8 columns.\nColumn names before dropping:\n Columns after dropping:\n\nCombine the genre1 column and genre column to create the final genre column for each artist.\nBefore cleaning (the green and red colored words are the genres, this only shows a part of the genres since it got 8 columns of genre for each artist):\n After cleaning:\n\nIt can be observe from the previous picture a lot of artist has no genre information. Fill these missing values in the genre field using the word ‘undefined’.\nAfter filling the missing values:\n\nMap the specific genre to a broader genre to reduce the number of genres. This step was done similarly to the last dataset.\nBefore mapping (there are 75 genres in total, here I onnly shows a part of them):\n After mapping:\n\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: spotify_artist.csv\n\n\n\nClean lyrics dataset:\n\n\nMerge all the lyrics dataset (genius_lyrics_2022.csv, genius_lyrics_global.csv, genius_lyrics.csv) into one data frame.\nBy checking, there are duplicates exists, dropping all the duplicates, since there are duplicates in different trending list. Print the duplicates rows before dropping:  After dropping duplicates, use df.duplicated().sum() to check if there are any duplicates, the result should be 0.\nDrop the rows with missing lyrics, since it will serve no use in analysis.\nBefore dropping: \nAfter dropping, use df.isnull().sum() to check if there are any missing values, the result should be 0.\nRemove the indication or introduction before each song’s lyric using regular expression.\nBefore removing:\n\nAfter removing (notice the [chours] and [verse] are gone, also the lyric’s information like contributors is removed as well):\n\nRemove all the unprintable and puncuation and non-English characters since it will not be used in the analysis.\nBefore removing:\n\nAfter removing(notice the lyric only contains non-English characters are now empty):\n\nIn this picture, we can see all the punctuations are gone: \nDrop all the new empty rows using df.dropna().\nCreate a bag of word from the lyrics column using CountVectorizer and use stop_words='english' parameter to remove the stop words and drop the original lyric column.\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: genius_lyrics_cleaned\n\n\n\nCleaning TikTok dataset\n\n\nCheck for missing value using df.isnull().sum(), there are no missing values in this dataset as shown in the picture below:\n\nCheck for duplicate value using duplicates = df_[df_tik.duplicated()], it will return a empty dataframe, showing there are no duplicates in this dataset.\nDrop not useful columns, album name and artist popularity.\nBefore dropping:\n\nAfter dropping, notice the colums dropped are gone:\n Rename the columns for better data retrieval. After rename the colums, the columns names are like this:\n\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: tiktok_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nClean last.fm listening events dataset\n\n\nThe listening events in the dataset are too many, 30,357,786 columns in total, which could cause trouble in analysis. So here we only randomly sample 10000 listening events from the dataset (This is just an initial decision, it could chagne as the analysis went on)\nThe columns in the dataset are squashed into one column, so i need to split it by the separator ’.\nBefore splitting:\n\nAfter splitting, notice the columns are now separated into four columns:\n\nCheck if there are any missing values in the sample dataset using colSums(is.na(df)), in this case there are no missing values in the sample dataset.\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: listening_events_sample.csv\n\n\n\nClean last.fm track datasets\n\n\nThe data itself is encode in tsv format, but the separator is not consistent where sometime it is tab and sometimes it is spaces. So it is impossible to read directly using pandas. First, I read the file as plain text and change all the separator to comma, then save the result as a .csv file.\nBefore changing the separator: \nAfter changing the separator and save as .csv file:\n\nThere are a lot of columns in the track name are clearly unreadable, consisting of ‘!’ Or simply dots and white spaces or something like Remove all the columns only consist with these with regular expression.\nBefore removing:  After removing (notice the meaningless columns are turned to NA): \nDrop all the rows with missing values and unprintable vlaues and write the cleaned dataset to a new csv file.\n\nA sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: tracks_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nClean last.fm user dataset\n\n\nPlenty of users’s country information is missing, I replace all the empty value using the word ‘unknown’\nData before cleaning: \nIt is worth noticing that there are a lot of -1 ages in this dataset. It consists of 0.3% of the data. With so much missing value, whether chaning to the mean or media will introduce huge change to the variance of the data (variance dropping 23 if using media, more if using mean). So I decided the replacing of the missing value need to be done after more analysis in the next stage.\nAlso from the distribution we can see that there are very few data has age over 80, so remove them as well. This is about 0.03% of the data.\nHere is the distribution of the age in the dataset: \nUsing bine to create a 5 years range bin in the age values for better analysis.\nBefore binning, the frequency of the age is like this: \nAfter binning: \n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: users_cleaned.csv"

I fetched the lyrcis for each songs in the dataset above, so there will be three lyrics dataset which follows the same format. I will only show the sample of one of them for the sake of brevity.\nDataset Name : genius_lyrics\nBasic information:\n\ntotal 3 columns, 100 rows\n\n\nColumn\nNon-Null Count\nDtype\n\n\n\n\ntrack_id\n100 non-null\nobject\n\n\nname\n100 non-null\nobject\n\n\nlyrics\n100 non-null\nobject\n\n\n\nA sample of the dataset:\n\nLink to the dataset: genius_lyrics.csv\n\n\n\nThe last.fm data, as mentioned in the previous section, provided valuable user information and activity data. However, the track data lacked audio analytical factors, consisting only of artist and track names, which is unable to conduct any meaningful analysis. To complement this, I utilized the Spotify API to search for and retrieve audio features for the music. The resulting dataset is stored in a JSON file. My plan was to collect the top 10,000 songs’ audio feature it is still under the process of collecting becasue Spotify API does have a rate limit, so it takes time to collect all the data. For now, the dataset only consist part of it, but the format is finalized.\nDataset Name : sample_track_info.json\nAPI Endpoint for searching track id: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search/track:{track_name}%20artist:{artist_name}\nAPI Endpoint for getting the audio feature: https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{track_id}\nBasic information:\n\ntotal 19 columns, 5700 rows\n\n\nColumn\nNon-Null Count\nDtype\n\n\n\n\ndanceability\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nenergy\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nkey\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\nloudness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nmode\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\nspeechiness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nacousticness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\ninstrumentalness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nliveness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nvalence\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\ntempo\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\ntype\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nid\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nuri\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\ntrack_href\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nanalysis_url\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nduration_ms\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\ntime_signature\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\ntrack_id\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\n\nA sample of the dataset:\n\nLink to the dataset: sample_track_info.json"

    "section": "Background: Research Works Done in this Field",
    "text": "Background: Research Works Done in this Field\nSince the great changes in musical industry, extensive researches were done in this realm, offering us the background knowledge and valuable insights. I shall address two important publications here which provide us important background knowledge and insight on understanding today’s music trend.\n\nPublication-1: Changing Their Tune: How Consumers’ Adoption of Online Streaming Affects Music Consumption and Discovery\nThis paper throughly described how the streaming service impact the way music were consumed and user behavior. The author segment the research into three parts, first they identify the increment contribution of streaming service is contributing to the overall music consumption. Secondly, it compare the diversity in the consumers’ choice in music categories between streaming service and traditional ownership model. Finally, it researched what could impact a song’s success in the streaming environment (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018).\nTo analysis the effects of adopting streaming service on individual music consumption, they use an anonymous third party service tracking the consumer’s platform preference and their listening behavior to create a panel of data. By applying a difference in differences (DiD) method, the authors compare the consumption differences between the group of people who adopt the streaming service and people who did not. According to their findings, adopting to streaming lead to a 49% increase of music consumption across all the platform. Furthermore listeners in streaming service tend to have a wider spectrum of music choices. The author noted it is benefit to those smaller artist to get attention but it also make the situation more competitive since the listeners now tend to discover new music instead of staying still (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018).\n\n\nPublication-2: Tastes and Age: A Study of the Relationship between Music Tastes and Age Cohorts\nIn this paper, the author tried to investigate the impact of ages’ influence on individual music preference. The main object is to discover the relationship between then contemporary music taste and age age cohorts (Glevarec, Nowak, and Mahut 2020). The data they used for research is the ELIPSS inquiry from 2013 conducted by the Centre of Socio-Political Data in Pairs. This enquires include 13 genres of music and with a sample space of 892. The research methodology employed a regression analysis on the socio-demographic variables including age, education, profession, gender of a person and their taste of music genres. The finding reveal that for most music genres, age of the listener is the dominate factor to determine whether it will be appreciate or not. It is also noticed that people tend to rate the artist higher when they are at a similar age with the listener. Also, the author went further and point out it can be inferred from the research that people are likely to be linked to an artist they encountered during their teenager (Glevarec, Nowak, and Mahut 2020).\n\n\nOther Relevent Works:\nThere are many other researches dive into the topic of the contemporary music trends in many perspective to provide us the background of this project. The trend can be split into three aspect, the trend for music content, the trend in music consumption and the trend in music creation.\n\nTrend in Music Contents:\nIn terms of music content, current researches indicating the lyric of the songs are getting simpler and the songs with simple lyrics tend to be more successful (Varnum et al. 2021). Also, according to research, the lyrics now more likely to contain negative emotions (Brand, Acerbi, and Mesoudi 2019). This is important to notice since the research done by Borg and Hokkanen shows that lyrics plays an significant role in a music’s success (Borg and Hokkanen 2011). There are also new genres emerging, Base on the second publication summary above, we can observe the new Z generation is the key audience of those novice genres (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018). According to Klement & Strambach, the local and extra-local knowledge source contribute to those new genres creation (Klement and Strambach 2019).\n\n\nTrend in Music Consumption:\nThe advent of streaming services has totally revolutionized music consumption as describe in the first publication’s summary. Additionally, changes also reflect on the form music been consumed. Nowadays music is often consume in combine with video or games. An good example is the TikTok. According to study, the more interactive mode in platform like TikTok short video make people foster affliction by mixing the music with image, video and text, and it is also shown as a way to self-express and connect people with similar afflictions (Vizcaı́no-Verdú and Abidin 2022).\n\n\nTrend in Music Creation:\nThere are also revolution in music creations. With more AI assistance tools emerging, even individual without traditional musical training could create songs, however it also means the standard for hit song is increasing (Liu 2019). Also the streaming service like Spotify enable artist to upload their work without the need of signing to a label. However, these technology doesn’t always promote the creation. THOMAS HODGSON described it as ‘Creative Ambivalence’ mainly caused by the opaque nature of recommending algorithm (Hodgson 2021). Artist might spend more time to align their work to the algorithm rather than being creative (Hodgson 2021)."

We hypothesize that the rise of streaming platforms, have significantly influenced on both music creation and consumption. And the as the Generation Z becoming the main consumer, there would be significant changes regarding the genre, rhythm and lyric of trending music. We also expect to see a trend where individual artist and artists who also from Gen Z are thriving."
