    "text": "Cleaning Spotify data of current trending songs:\n\n\nFirst I merge the data from three files (global_top_50.csv, billboard_features.csv, billboard_2022_features.csv) containing recent trending music in Spotify. Because they have the same format, I just need to combine them into a data frame.\nThere are a lot of not useful colums containing various urls as shown in the picture below. Drop the unnecessary columns like time_signature, analysis_url, track_href… to lower the data dimension. Before cleaning the columns looks like this:  After cleaning, noticed all the url columns are gone: \nCheck if there are any missing values, in this case, the dataset does not contain any, like the picture below: \nIn some case there are multipy artists for For the case where a track contain more than one artiest, just leave the prominent one to keep constant with other datasets.\nAn example of multiple artists (the red words are the artist ids): \nSince we are concern about the genre information for each song, add genre column which get data from the artist dataset, using the genre information from the artist dataset spotify_artist.csv.\nColumns after adding genre information: \n\nA sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\n\n\nsample\n\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: spotify_current_all.csv\n\n\n\nClean historical trending musics:\n\n\nFirst, I noticed the column name is too redundancy, so I changed them so they are easier to retrieve and also consistent with the previous contemporary music data.\nColumn names Before cleaning:  After cleaning: \nCheck if there are any missing values, in this case, there are no missing values \nDrop the ‘liveness’ column because it is not relevant to the music itself.\nColumns after dropping the ‘liveness’ column: \nThere are too many genres in this dataset like shown in the picture below. To make it better for analysis, I map each specific genre using regular expression and hard code mapping.\nBefore mapping:  After mapping:\n\nCreate a year binning over the year column. Make the bin width of 5 years.\nBefore binning, the year column is like this, just separate years indicate the year of the song:\n$ year        : num [1:603] 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 ... After bining, the years is turned to two groups, like shown in the picture below:\n\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset: \nLink to the cleaned dataset: top50MusicFrom2010-2019_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nClean the artist dataset:\n\n\nThere are too many not useful columns like various urls so drop them first. Also, each artist has 8 columns of genre, to keep it consistent with other datasets, drop the genre columns and only keep the priority genre. However, the priority genre is either stored in the genres1 column or the genres column, depending on how many genres the artist have, so here I only drop the genres2 to genres8 columns.\nColumn names before dropping:\n Columns after dropping:\n\nCombine the genre1 column and genre column to create the final genre column for each artist.\nBefore cleaning (the green and red colored words are the genres, this only shows a part of the genres since it got 8 columns of genre for each artist):\n After cleaning:\n\nIt can be observe from the previous picture a lot of artist has no genre information. Fill these missing values in the genre field using the word ‘undefined’.\nAfter filling the missing values:\n\nMap the specific genre to a broader genre to reduce the number of genres. This step was done similarly to the last dataset.\nBefore mapping (there are 75 genres in total, here I onnly shows a part of them):\n After mapping:\n\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: spotify_artist.csv\n\n\n\nClean lyrics dataset:\n\n\nMerge all the lyrics dataset (genius_lyrics_2022.csv, genius_lyrics_global.csv, genius_lyrics.csv) into one data frame.\nBy checking, there are duplicates exists, dropping all the duplicates, since there are duplicates in different trending list. Print the duplicates rows before dropping:  After dropping duplicates, use df.duplicated().sum() to check if there are any duplicates, the result should be 0.\nDrop the rows with missing lyrics, since it will serve no use in analysis.\nBefore dropping: \nAfter dropping, use df.isnull().sum() to check if there are any missing values, the result should be 0.\nRemove the indication or introduction before each song’s lyric using regular expression.\nBefore removing:\n\nAfter removing (notice the [chours] and [verse] are gone, also the lyric’s information like contributors is removed as well):\n\nRemove all the unprintable and puncuation and non-English characters since it will not be used in the analysis.\nBefore removing:\n\nAfter removing(notice the lyric only contains non-English characters are now empty):\n\nIn this picture, we can see all the punctuations are gone: \nDrop all the new empty rows using df.dropna().\nCreate a bag of word from the lyrics column using CountVectorizer and use stop_words='english' parameter to remove the stop words and drop the original lyric column.\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: genius_lyrics_cleaned\n\n\n\nCleaning TikTok dataset\n\n\nCheck for missing value using df.isnull().sum(), there are no missing values in this dataset as shown in the picture below:\n\nCheck for duplicate value using duplicates = df_[df_tik.duplicated()], it will return a empty dataframe, showing there are no duplicates in this dataset.\nDrop not useful columns, album name and artist popularity.\nBefore dropping:\n\nAfter dropping, notice the colums dropped are gone:\n Rename the columns for better data retrieval. After rename the colums, the columns names are like this:\n\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: tiktok_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nClean last.fm listening events dataset\n\n\nThe listening events in the dataset are too many, 30,357,786 columns in total, which could cause trouble in analysis. So here we only randomly sample 10000 listening events from the dataset (This is just an initial decision, it could chagne as the analysis went on)\nThe columns in the dataset are squashed into one column, so i need to split it by the separator ’.\nBefore splitting:\n\nAfter splitting, notice the columns are now separated into four columns:\n\nCheck if there are any missing values in the sample dataset using colSums(is.na(df)), in this case there are no missing values in the sample dataset.\n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: listening_events_sample.csv\n\n\n\nClean last.fm track datasets\n\n\nThe data itself is encode in tsv format, but the separator is not consistent where sometime it is tab and sometimes it is spaces. So it is impossible to read directly using pandas. First, I read the file as plain text and change all the separator to comma, then save the result as a .csv file.\nBefore changing the separator: \nAfter changing the separator and save as .csv file:\n\nThere are a lot of columns in the track name are clearly unreadable, consisting of ‘!’ Or simply dots and white spaces or something like Remove all the columns only consist with these with regular expression.\nBefore removing:  After removing (notice the meaningless columns are turned to NA): \nDrop all the rows with missing values and unprintable vlaues and write the cleaned dataset to a new csv file.\n\nA sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: tracks_cleaned.csv\n\n\n\nClean last.fm user dataset\n\n\nPlenty of users’s country information is missing, I replace all the empty value using the word ‘unknown’\nData before cleaning: \nIt is worth noticing that there are a lot of -1 ages in this dataset. It consists of 0.3% of the data. With so much missing value, whether chaning to the mean or media will introduce huge change to the variance of the data (variance dropping 23 if using media, more if using mean). So I decided the replacing of the missing value need to be done after more analysis in the next stage.\nAlso from the distribution we can see that there are very few data has age over 80, so remove them as well. This is about 0.03% of the data.\nHere is the distribution of the age in the dataset: \nUsing bining to create a 5 years range bin in the age values for better analysis.\nBefore binning, the frequency of the age is like this: \nAfter binning: \n\nHere is a sample of the cleaned dataset:\n\nLink to the cleaned dataset: users_cleaned.csv"

My plan was to collect the top 10,000 songs’ audio feature it is still under the process of collecting becasue Spotify API does have a rate limit, so it takes time to collect all the data. For now, the dataset only consist part of it, but the format is finalized.\nDataset Name : sample_track_info.json\nAPI Endpoint for searching track id: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search/track:{track_name}%20artist:{artist_name}\nAPI Endpoint for getting the audio feature: https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{track_id}\nBasic information:\n\ntotal 19 columns, 5700 rows\n\n\nColumn\nNon-Null Count\nDtype\n\n\n\n\ndanceability\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nenergy\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nkey\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\nloudness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nmode\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\nspeechiness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nacousticness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\ninstrumentalness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nliveness\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\nvalence\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\ntempo\n5700 non-null\nfloat64\n\n\ntype\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nid\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nuri\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\ntrack_href\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nanalysis_url\n5700 non-null\nobject\n\n\nduration_ms\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\ntime_signature\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\ntrack_id\n5700 non-null\nint64\n\n\n\nA sample of the dataset:\n\nLink to the dataset: sample_track_info.json"

Notably, the third most prevalent category is ‘others,’ which comprises songs that don’t fit neatly into established genres. This might hint at the growing trend of genreless music. However, a comparison with older songs is necessary to determine if this is a recent phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n# load the data\ndf_spotify_history = pd.read_csv('../data/01-modified-data/top50MusicFrom2010-2019_cleaned.csv')\n\n\ndf_spotify_history.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nartist\ngenre\nyear\nbeat\nenergy\ndanceability\nloudness\nvalence\nduration\nacousticness\nspeechiness\npopularity\nyear_group\n\n\n\n\n0\nHey, Soul Sister\nTrain\npop\n2010\n97\n89\n67\n-4\n80\n217\n19\n4\n83\n2010-2014\n\n\n1\nLove The Way You Lie\nEminem\nhip_hop_rap\n2010\n87\n93\n75\n-5\n64\n263\n24\n23\n82\n2010-2014\n\n\n2\nTiK ToK\nKesha\npop\n2010\n120\n84\n76\n-3\n71\n200\n10\n14\n80\n2010-2014\n\n\n3\nBad Romance\nLady Gaga\npop\n2010\n119\n92\n70\n-4\n71\n295\n0\n4\n79\n2010-2014\n\n\n4\nJust the Way You Are\nBruno Mars\npop\n2010\n109\n84\n64\n-5\n43\n221\n2\n4\n78\n2010-2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics summary\n\ndf_spotify_history.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nbeat\nenergy\ndanceability\nloudness\nvalence\nduration\nacousticness\nspeechiness\npopularity\n\n\n\n\ncount\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n\n\nmean\n2014.592040\n118.545605\n70.504146\n64.379768\n-5.578773\n52.225539\n224.674959\n14.326700\n8.358209\n66.520730\n\n\nstd\n2.607057\n24.795358\n16.310664\n13.378718\n2.798020\n22.513020\n34.130059\n20.766165\n7.483162\n14.517746\n\n\nmin\n2010.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n-60.000000\n0.000000\n134.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n2013.000000\n100.000000\n61.000000\n57.000000\n-6.000000\n35.000000\n202.000000\n2.000000\n4.000000\n60.000000\n\n\n50%\n2015.000000\n120.000000\n74.000000\n66.000000\n-5.000000\n52.000000\n221.000000\n6.000000\n5.000000\n69.000000\n\n\n75%\n2017.000000\n129.000000\n82.000000\n73.000000\n-4.000000\n69.000000\n239.500000\n17.000000\n9.000000\n76.000000\n\n\nmax\n2019.000000\n206.000000\n98.000000\n97.000000\n-2.000000\n98.000000\n424.000000\n99.000000\n48.000000\n99.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe from the basic statistic that most of the statistic are quite similar to the ones in the currently hot songs.\n\ndf_spotify_history.columns\n\nIndex(['title', 'artist', 'genre', 'year', 'beat', 'energy', 'danceability',\n       'loudness', 'valence', 'duration', 'acousticness', 'speechiness',\n       'popularity', 'year_group'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\ndf_histroy_melted  = df_spotify_history.melt(id_vars=['title', 'artist', 'year', 'beat', 'energy', 'danceability',\n       'loudness', 'valence', 'duration', 'acousticness', 'speechiness',\n       'popularity', 'year_group'], var_name='feature', value_name='value')\n\n\nsns.countplot(x='value', data=df_histroy_melted, hue='value')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, it’s evident that the past decade witnessed an overwhelming dominance of pop music, comprising nearly all of the top songs. Electronic dance music emerged as the second most successful genre, with hip hop not even ranking third in popularity. There appears to have been some significant shifts in musical trends over the past decade. To highlight these changes more clearly, we should create another graph comparing the genre proportions from the last decade with those in the current top songs.\n\n# construst the dataset\ndf1 = df_spotify_history['genre'].value_counts() / df_spotify_history['genre'].value_counts().sum()\n\ndf2 = df_spotify_track['broad_genre'].value_counts() / df_spotify_track['broad_genre'].value_counts().sum()\n\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(df1)\n# df1.set_index('genre').T\n\n\ndf1\ndf1.reset_index(inplace=True)\ndf1['type'] = 'history'\n\n\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(df2)\ndf2.reset_index(inplace=True)\ndf2['type'] = 'current'\ndf2.rename(columns={'broad_genre':'genre'}, inplace=True)\n\n\ndf_genre_compare = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)\n\n\nsns.barplot(x='genre', y='count', data=df_genre_compare, hue='type')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.ylabel('Percentage')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot contrasts the proportion of each genre in the current top songs with those from the past decade. Notably, pop music’s share has seen a substantial decline, while other genres, particularly hip hop (now the second most prevalent genre in current top songs), have witnessed a surge. A significant observation is the minimal percentage of the ‘others’ category in past top songs, which now claims a notable share. This might be attributed to the emergence of hybrid genres like ‘gauze pop’ and ‘escape room’ that don’t fit conventional classifications and have only gained recognition recently. Latin music has also experienced a resurgence. In summary, there’s been a shift in genre distribution over the years, but a more detailed time-based analysis is needed to capture the full evolution.\n\ndf_genre_change =

Nonetheless, the overarching trend suggests a decrease in the popularity of pop music. Hip hop music experienced a marked drop starting in 2010, stabilizing for several years thereafter. From 2015 onwards, hip hop’s proportion began to rise again. Furthermore, the “others” category, representing emerging genres not easily classified into traditional categories, began to see an uptick starting in 2018.\n\n\n\nTo do so, we will need to see the distribution of multipy musical features in the top songs over time.\n\nsns.set_theme()\n\n# Create line plots for each genre or attribute\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='beat', label='Beat', estimator='median')\nsns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='energy', label='Energy')\nsns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='danceability', label='Danceability')\n# ...

The line represents the median, while the shaded area encompasses the 25th to 75th percentiles. Contrary to expectations, the distributions of these features have not become more homogeneous over time. In fact, their distributions have remained relatively consistent. Notably, the range of beats has widened compared to earlier years. Regarding median values, there is a noticeable decline in both beats and energy over the years, while danceability has seen an upward trend.\n\n\n\n\n# load the data\ndf_tik_tok =

Songs trending on TikTok tend to cluster around higher energy and danceability levels. This may be attributed to TikTok being a short-video platform, where more energetic and danceable songs are likely to thrive. In contrast, songs popular on streaming services appear more dispersed without an evident pattern. Notably, there are outliers: highly popular songs that aren’t particularly danceable, meriting further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n# Load the data\ndf_tracks = pd.read_csv('../data/00-raw-data/tracks.csv')\n\n\ncorr_1 = df_tracks.corr(method='pearson',numeric_only=True)  \n\nmask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr_1, dtype=bool)) \nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 9)) \ncmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True) \n\nsns.heatmap(corr_1, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0,\n            square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .5}, annot=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heatmap, we can discern that most variables do not exhibit strong correlations with each other. Importantly, none of the values showcase a high correlation with popularity. The features most positively correlated with popularity are loudness and energy, with both having nearly identical correlation values. On the other end, acousticness is the most negatively correlated feature, followed closely by instrumentalness. Among all the features, energy and loudness are the most closely related, which makes sense as loudness often corresponds with a song’s energy. Based on these observations, we can delve deeper into the relationship between popularity, energy, and loudness. Additionally, both danceability and loudness have a positive correlation with a song’s valence.\n\ndf_tracks['release_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_tracks['release_date'], errors='coerce')\n\n\ndf_2010 = df_tracks[df_tracks['release_date'].dt.year &gt;= 2010]\n\n\ndf_2010['type'] = 'Others'\n\n/var/folders/s0/4jmlz4bn2jv0712y1pv_xnbh0000gn/T/ipykernel_2997/361325449.py:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  df_2010['type'] = 'Others'\n\n\n\ndf_energy = df_2010[['energy', 'type']]\ndf_energy_popular = df_spotify_history[['energy']].copy()\ndf_energy_popular['energy'] = df_energy_popular['energy'] / 100\ndf_energy_popular['type'] = 'Popular'\n\n\ndf_compare_energy = pd.concat([df_energy, df_energy_popular], axis=0)\n\n\nsns.boxplot(x=\"type\", y='energy', data=df_compare_energy)\nplt.xlabel('Popularity')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot contrasts the energy distribution of top songs with that of all songs since 2010.

Furthermore, the energy of top songs tends to cluster within the 0.6-0.8 range, whereas the energy distribution for all songs is more dispersed.\n\ndf_tracks['year'] = df_tracks['release_date'].dt.year\ndf_spotify_history['energy'] = df_spotify_history['energy'] / 100 \n\n\nlen(df_tracks[df_tracks['year'] == 2010])\n\n8761\n\n\n\nlen(df_spotify_history[df_spotify_history['year'] == 2010])\n\n51\n\n\n\n# Bootstrap sampling the enegry column for each year beacuse lack of data\n\nbootstrap_samples = {'energy': [], 'year': []}\n\nfor year, group in df_spotify_history.groupby('year'):\n    for _ in range(100):  # bootstrap 100 times for each year\n        sample = group['energy'].sample(len(group), replace=True).tolist()\n        bootstrap_samples['year'] = bootstrap_samples['year'] + [year] * len(sample)\n        bootstrap_samples['energy'] = bootstrap_samples['energy'] + sample\n\n\ndf_bootstrap = pd.DataFrame(bootstrap_samples)\n\n\nsns.set_theme()\n\n# Create line plots for each genre or attribute\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=df_tracks[df_tracks['year'] &gt; 2010], x='year', y='energy', label='Energy_All', estimator='median')\nsns.lineplot(data=df_bootstrap, x='year', y='energy', label='Energy_Popular', estimator='median')\n\n# sns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='loudness', label='Loudness of Popular Song', estimator='median')\n# sns.lineplot(data=df_tracks[df_tracks['year'] &gt; 2010], x='year', y='loudness', label='Loudness of All Song', estimator='median')\n\n# ...

Notably, while the median energy value of top songs consistently surpasses that of all songs, this gap has been narrowing over time. Furthermore, there’s a discernible downward trend in song energy over the years. This could reflect a shift in musical preferences or a change in the characteristics of listeners.\n\n\n\n\n# load the data\ndf_listener = pd.read_csv('../data/01-modified-data/last.fm.data/users_cleaned.csv')\n\n\ndf_listener.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_id\ncountry\nage\ngender\ncreation_time\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\nUK\n30-35\nm\n2002-10-29 01:00:00\n\n\n1\n6\nAT\n25-30\nn\n2003-07-23 02:00:00\n\n\n2\n14\nUK\n45-50\nm\n2003-02-18 21:44:13\n\n\n3\n15\nUS\n25-30\nm\n2003-02-24 03:30:33\n\n\n4\n20\nunknown\nNaN\nn\n2003-03-19 13:18:50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset is mostly categroical data so there is no statistical summary for this dataset.\n\norder = df_listener['age'].value_counts().index\nsns.countplot(x='age', data=df_listener, order=order)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe are particularly interested in the age demographics.

This is somewhat surprising, as one might expect a more balanced number of male and female listeners. While there is a segment of users who do not disclose their gender, it doesn’t offset the noticeable gender imbalance.\n\nsns.countplot(x='gender', data=df_listen_info)\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='gender', ylabel='count'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, it’s evident that males account for the majority of the listening events. This suggests that males are more inclined to listen to music frequently, as their representation in listening events is disproportionately higher than their actual numbers compared to females. Interestingly, individuals who choose not to disclose their gender appear to listen less frequently. Despite having a larger listener count, the number of listening events associated with this group is lower than that of females.\n\nsns.countplot(x='age', data=df_listener, hue='gender')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\n\n(array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]),\n [Text(0, 0, '30-35'),\n  Text(1, 0, '25-30'),\n  Text(2, 0, '45-50'),\n  Text(3, 0, '35-40'),\n  Text(4, 0, '20-25'),\n  Text(5, 0, '50-55'),\n  Text(6, 0, '40-45'),\n  Text(7, 0, '5-10'),\n  Text(8, 0, '15-20'),\n  Text(9, 0, '55-60'),\n  Text(10, 0, '60-65'),\n  Text(11, 0, '0-5'),\n  Text(12, 0, '70-75'),\n  Text(13, 0, '65-70'),\n  Text(14, 0, '10-15')])\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, it’s evident that males dominate the listener count across all age groups.

Becasue other age group has too small sample, here we only look at the three most major age group. It is interesting to see that some of the top ranked artist were not relevant to music, instead there are white noise and other sound product. It is clear that each group favors different type of aritist, though there are some overlapping. In the age group 25-30 Beyonce was the most played artist, while in the age group 20-25, it is Tame Impala. In the age group 15-20, it is Billie Eillish. This also shows how the age affect the music taste, where Beyonce was famous from the mid 1990s, and Tame Impala made their fame on 2010s while Billie Eillish was becoming golbal famous in about 2019. Apart from the affect of when the artist made their fame, it can also be observed that foreign languaage artist like BTS has ranked third in the group of age 15-20. This could be a sign of the globalization of music. It’s also interesting to see that the high ranked artist in the age group of 15-20 played most are generally cross genres, while in the age group of 25-30, the high ranked artist are more focus on a single genre.\n\n# Read the data\ndf_sound_info = pd.read_csv('../data/01-modified-data/last.fm.data/last_fm_track_info.csv')\n\n\n# merge the dataset\n\ndf_listen_sound = df_listen_info.merge(df_sound_info, how='left', left_on='track_id', right_on='track_id')\n\n\n# Drop the missing value\ndf_listen_sound.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n\ndf_listen_sound.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_id\ntrack_id\nalbum_id\ntimestamp\ncountry\nage\ngender\ncreation_time\ndanceability\nenergy\nkey\nloudness\nmode\nspeechiness\nacousticness\ninstrumentalness\nliveness\nvalence\ntempo\nid\n\n\n\n\n1\n4462\n41878638\n10034639\n2020-01-10 04:40:28\nCL\n25-30\nm\n2006-03-21 17:47:37\n0.415\n0.104\n0.0\n-11.830\n1.0\n0.0426\n0.955000\n0.000004\n0.1040\n0.180\n82.006\n4g2WiijzSKzH8PApKDbadN\n\n\n2\n43790\n38231384\n9469808\n2020-02-26 22:33:45\nIT\n15-20\nm\n2010-01-07 21:10:59\n0.708\n0.384\n5.0\n-12.427\n1.0\n0.0302\n0.089300\n0.841000\n0.0961\n0.691\n87.961\n488u1IbVEsaC7fxjABWjHx\n\n\n5\n51493\n43590126\n444628\n2020-01-23 10:15:28\nUK\n20-25\nm\n2010-07-21 11:40:40\n0.486\n0.617\n5.0\n-7.115\n0.0\n0.0287\n0.095400\n0.000003\n0.1090\n0.417\n138.015\n1mea3bSkSGXuIRvnydlB5b\n\n\n13\n2194\n41200695\n19859102\n2020-03-09 19:06:27\nUK\n20-25\nm\n2005-08-22 06:45:25\n0.566\n0.869\n2.0\n-6.084\n1.0\n0.1000\n0.000916\n0.003460\n0.1140\n0.647\n178.113\n3C84jaEdYxiq8LC4jwYqj6\n\n\n21\n659\n6989555\n5566359\n2020-01-20 20:07:24\nDE\n20-25\nm\n2004-12-27 21:33:40\n0.376\n0.982\n5.0\n-3.779\n0.0\n0.0625\n0.000057\n0.000005\n0.1600\n0.150\n148.926\n6REc2Tq4G2RW5zKXtusTLF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_listen_sound = df_listen_sound[(df_listen_sound['age'] == '15-20') | (df_listen_sound['age'] == '20-25') | (df_listen_sound['age'] == '25-30')]\n\n\nsns.violinplot(data=df_listen_sound, x=\"age\", y=\"tempo\")\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='age', ylabel='tempo'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.violinplot(data=df_listen_sound, x=\"age\", y=\"danceability\")\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='age', ylabel='danceability'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the previous two plots reveals insights into the preferences for danceability and energy across different age groups. For both features, the distributions for the age groups 25-30 and 20-25 exhibit similar shapes, suggesting comparable musical tastes within these age brackets. Conversely, the 15-20 age group displays a distinct pattern, characterized by a bimodal distribution with two clear peaks. This bimodality indicates diverse listening habits within this younger age bracket. Additionally, the median for the 15-20 age group is noticeably lower. A possible explanation for this deviation could be a subset of listeners in this age group who have a preference for tracks with characteristics akin to white noise which has 0 tempo and 0 danceability.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, in this EDA process, we can gain following insight:\n\nPop music is still the king in the music, but it is losing its popularity. Hip hop is becoming more and more popular and also new genres are raising fast in the recent years.\nInstead of going more homogeneous, the popular songs are becoming more diverse in terms of some musical features include tempo and energy.\nThe tempo and energy in the popular songs are decreasing over time, while danceability is more and more popular.\nCompare with the popular songs in the streaming service, platform like tik tok prefers more energetic and danceable songs.\nThe features most positively realted to popularity is loudness, energy and explicit. The features most negatively related to popularity is acousticness and instrumentalness.\nThough energy is decreasing over time in popular songs, it is still higher than the median of overall songs. However, the gap is narrowing over time quickly.\n20-25 years old people is the age group has greatest number in streaming services, following by 15-20 years old and 25-30 years old.\nThere exist a serious unbanalce in gender of the users in streaming music services.\nPeople did not discolse their gender tend to have less listening events.\nThe music taste in different year group is noticable, even 15-20 and 20-25 has different top artist. Also, the music feature they prefer is slightly different too.\n\n\n\nBase on these conclusion from priliminary EDA, we can now refiend our hypothesis and research questions in the following way:\n\nAs the generation Z is becoming the main force of the music consumer, the music is becoming more diverse and less energetic while more danceable.\nThis could also lead to the decline of the popularity of pop music or other classic genres, instead, new genres which fuse those genres before are emerging and taking the market fast.\nGen Z will be more preferring to newer famous artists, and they are more open to music globalizaiton.\nPlatform like tik tok will be promoting more energetic and danceable songs in the future.\nIn the new generation, listeners could be clustered into more groups than before for haveing differnet music taste.\n\nIt is sure that more analysis need to be conduct after this EDA process."

Notably, the third most prevalent category is ‘others,’ which comprises songs that don’t fit neatly into established genres. This might hint at the growing trend of genreless music. However, a comparison with older songs is necessary to determine if this is a recent phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n# load the data\ndf_spotify_history = pd.read_csv('../data/01-modified-data/top50MusicFrom2010-2019_cleaned.csv')\n\n\ndf_spotify_history.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nartist\ngenre\nyear\nbeat\nenergy\ndanceability\nloudness\nvalence\nduration\nacousticness\nspeechiness\npopularity\nyear_group\n\n\n\n\n0\nHey, Soul Sister\nTrain\npop\n2010\n97\n89\n67\n-4\n80\n217\n19\n4\n83\n2010-2014\n\n\n1\nLove The Way You Lie\nEminem\nhip_hop_rap\n2010\n87\n93\n75\n-5\n64\n263\n24\n23\n82\n2010-2014\n\n\n2\nTiK ToK\nKesha\npop\n2010\n120\n84\n76\n-3\n71\n200\n10\n14\n80\n2010-2014\n\n\n3\nBad Romance\nLady Gaga\npop\n2010\n119\n92\n70\n-4\n71\n295\n0\n4\n79\n2010-2014\n\n\n4\nJust the Way You Are\nBruno Mars\npop\n2010\n109\n84\n64\n-5\n43\n221\n2\n4\n78\n2010-2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics summary\n\ndf_spotify_history.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nbeat\nenergy\ndanceability\nloudness\nvalence\nduration\nacousticness\nspeechiness\npopularity\n\n\n\n\ncount\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n603.000000\n\n\nmean\n2014.592040\n118.545605\n70.504146\n64.379768\n-5.578773\n52.225539\n224.674959\n14.326700\n8.358209\n66.520730\n\n\nstd\n2.607057\n24.795358\n16.310664\n13.378718\n2.798020\n22.513020\n34.130059\n20.766165\n7.483162\n14.517746\n\n\nmin\n2010.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n-60.000000\n0.000000\n134.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n2013.000000\n100.000000\n61.000000\n57.000000\n-6.000000\n35.000000\n202.000000\n2.000000\n4.000000\n60.000000\n\n\n50%\n2015.000000\n120.000000\n74.000000\n66.000000\n-5.000000\n52.000000\n221.000000\n6.000000\n5.000000\n69.000000\n\n\n75%\n2017.000000\n129.000000\n82.000000\n73.000000\n-4.000000\n69.000000\n239.500000\n17.000000\n9.000000\n76.000000\n\n\nmax\n2019.000000\n206.000000\n98.000000\n97.000000\n-2.000000\n98.000000\n424.000000\n99.000000\n48.000000\n99.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe from the basic statistic that most of the statistic are quite similar to the ones in the currently hot songs.\n\ndf_spotify_history.columns\n\nIndex(['title', 'artist', 'genre', 'year', 'beat', 'energy', 'danceability',\n       'loudness', 'valence', 'duration', 'acousticness', 'speechiness',\n       'popularity', 'year_group'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\ndf_histroy_melted  = df_spotify_history.melt(id_vars=['title', 'artist', 'year', 'beat', 'energy', 'danceability',\n       'loudness', 'valence', 'duration', 'acousticness', 'speechiness',\n       'popularity', 'year_group'], var_name='feature', value_name='value')\n\n\nsns.countplot(x='value', data=df_histroy_melted, hue='value')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, it’s evident that the past decade witnessed an overwhelming dominance of pop music, comprising nearly all of the top songs. Electronic dance music emerged as the second most successful genre, with hip hop not even ranking third in popularity. There appears to have been some significant shifts in musical trends over the past decade. To highlight these changes more clearly, we should create another graph comparing the genre proportions from the last decade with those in the current top songs.\n\n# construst the dataset\ndf1 = df_spotify_history['genre'].value_counts() / df_spotify_history['genre'].value_counts().sum()\n\ndf2 = df_spotify_track['broad_genre'].value_counts() / df_spotify_track['broad_genre'].value_counts().sum()\n\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(df1)\n# df1.set_index('genre').T\n\n\ndf1\ndf1.reset_index(inplace=True)\ndf1['type'] = 'history'\n\n\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(df2)\ndf2.reset_index(inplace=True)\ndf2['type'] = 'current'\ndf2.rename(columns={'broad_genre':'genre'}, inplace=True)\n\n\ndf_genre_compare = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)\n\n\nsns.barplot(x='genre', y='count', data=df_genre_compare, hue='type')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.ylabel('Percentage')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot contrasts the proportion of each genre in the current top songs with those from the past decade. Notably, pop music’s share has seen a substantial decline, while other genres, particularly hip hop (now the second most prevalent genre in current top songs), have witnessed a surge. A significant observation is the minimal percentage of the ‘others’ category in past top songs, which now claims a notable share. This might be attributed to the emergence of hybrid genres like ‘gauze pop’ and ‘escape room’ that don’t fit conventional classifications and have only gained recognition recently. Latin music has also experienced a resurgence. In summary, there’s been a shift in genre distribution over the years, but a more detailed time-based analysis is needed to capture the full evolution.\n\ndf_genre_change =

Nonetheless, the overarching trend suggests a decrease in the popularity of pop music. Hip hop music experienced a marked drop starting in 2010, stabilizing for several years thereafter. From 2015 onwards, hip hop’s proportion began to rise again. Furthermore, the “others” category, representing emerging genres not easily classified into traditional categories, began to see an uptick starting in 2018.\n\n\n\nTo do so, we will need to see the distribution of multipy musical features in the top songs over time.\n\nsns.set_theme()\n\n# Create line plots for each genre or attribute\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='beat', label='Beat', estimator='median')\nsns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='energy', label='Energy')\nsns.lineplot(data=df_spotify_history, x='year', y='danceability', label='Danceability')\n# ...

The line represents the median, while the shaded area encompasses the 25th to 75th percentiles. Contrary to expectations, the distributions of these features have not become more homogeneous over time. In fact, their distributions have remained relatively consistent. Notably, the range of beats has widened compared to earlier years. Regarding median values, there is a noticeable decline in both beats and energy over the years, while danceability has seen an upward trend.\n\n\n\n\n# load the data\ndf_tik_tok =

Songs trending on TikTok tend to cluster around higher energy and danceability levels. This may be attributed to TikTok being a short-video platform, where more energetic and danceable songs are likely to thrive. In contrast, songs popular on streaming services appear more dispersed without an evident pattern. Notably, there are outliers: highly popular songs that aren’t particularly danceable, meriting further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n# Load the data\ndf_tracks = pd.read_csv('../data/00-raw-data/tracks.csv')\n\n\ncorr_1 = df_tracks.corr(method='pearson',numeric_only=True)  \n\nmask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr_1, dtype=bool)) \nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 9)) \ncmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True) \n\nsns.heatmap(corr_1, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0,\n            square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .5}, annot=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heatmap, we can discern that most variables do not exhibit strong correlations with each other. Importantly, none of the values showcase a high correlation with popularity. The features most positively correlated with popularity are loudness and energy, with both having nearly identical correlation values. On the other end, acousticness is the most negatively correlated feature, followed closely by instrumentalness. Among all the features, energy and loudness are the most closely related, which makes sense as loudness often corresponds with a song’s energy. Based on these observations, we can delve deeper into the relationship between popularity, energy, and loudness. Additionally, both danceability and loudness have a positive correlation with a song’s valence.\n\ndf_tracks['release_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_tracks['release_date'], errors='coerce')\n\n\ndf_2010 = df_tracks[df_tracks['release_date'].dt.year &gt;= 2010]\n\n\ndf_2010['type'] = 'Others'\n\n/var/folders/s0/4jmlz4bn2jv0712y1pv_xnbh0000gn/T/ipykernel_2997/361325449.py:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  df_2010['type'] = 'Others'\n\n\n\ndf_energy = df_2010[['energy', 'type']]\ndf_energy_popular = df_spotify_history[['energy']].copy()\ndf_energy_popular['energy'] = df_energy_popular['energy'] / 100\ndf_energy_popular['type'] = 'Popular'\n\n\ndf_compare_energy = pd.concat([df_energy, df_energy_popular], axis=0)\n\n\nsns.boxplot(x=\"type\", y='energy', data=df_compare_energy)\nplt.xlabel('Popularity')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot contrasts the energy distribution of top songs with that of all songs since 2010.

Notably, while the median energy value of top songs consistently surpasses that of all songs, this gap has been narrowing over time. Furthermore, there’s a discernible downward trend in song energy over the years. This could reflect a shift in musical preferences or a change in the characteristics of listeners.\n\n\n\n\n# load the data\ndf_listener = pd.read_csv('../data/01-modified-data/last.fm.data/users_cleaned.csv')\n\n\ndf_listener.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_id\ncountry\nage\ngender\ncreation_time\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\nUK\n30-35\nm\n2002-10-29 01:00:00\n\n\n1\n6\nAT\n25-30\nn\n2003-07-23 02:00:00\n\n\n2\n14\nUK\n45-50\nm\n2003-02-18 21:44:13\n\n\n3\n15\nUS\n25-30\nm\n2003-02-24 03:30:33\n\n\n4\n20\nunknown\nNaN\nn\n2003-03-19 13:18:50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset is mostly categroical data so there is no statistical summary for this dataset.\n\norder = df_listener['age'].value_counts().index\nsns.countplot(x='age', data=df_listener, order=order)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe are particularly interested in the age demographics.

This is somewhat surprising, as one might expect a more balanced number of male and female listeners. While there is a segment of users who do not disclose their gender, it doesn’t offset the noticeable gender imbalance.\n\nsns.countplot(x='gender', data=df_listen_info)\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='gender', ylabel='count'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, it’s evident that males account for the majority of the listening events. This suggests that males are more inclined to listen to music frequently, as their representation in listening events is disproportionately higher than their actual numbers compared to females. Interestingly, individuals who choose not to disclose their gender appear to listen less frequently. Despite having a larger listener count, the number of listening events associated with this group is lower than that of females.\n\nsns.countplot(x='age', data=df_listener, hue='gender')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\n\n(array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]),\n [Text(0, 0, '30-35'),\n  Text(1, 0, '25-30'),\n  Text(2, 0, '45-50'),\n  Text(3, 0, '35-40'),\n  Text(4, 0, '20-25'),\n  Text(5, 0, '50-55'),\n  Text(6, 0, '40-45'),\n  Text(7, 0, '5-10'),\n  Text(8, 0, '15-20'),\n  Text(9, 0, '55-60'),\n  Text(10, 0, '60-65'),\n  Text(11, 0, '0-5'),\n  Text(12, 0, '70-75'),\n  Text(13, 0, '65-70'),\n  Text(14, 0, '10-15')])\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, it’s evident that males dominate the listener count across all age groups.

Becasue other age group has too small sample, here we only look at the three most major age group. It is interesting to see that some of the top ranked artist were not relevant to music, instead there are white noise and other sound product. It is clear that each group favors different type of aritist, though there are some overlapping. In the age group 25-30 Beyonce was the most played artist, while in the age group 20-25, it is Tame Impala. In the age group 15-20, it is Billie Eillish. This also shows how the age affect the music taste, where Beyonce was famous from the mid 1990s, and Tame Impala made their fame on 2010s while Billie Eillish was becoming golbal famous in about 2019. Apart from the affect of when the artist made their fame, it can also be observed that foreign languaage artist like BTS has ranked third in the group of age 15-20. This could be a sign of the globalization of music. It’s also interesting to see that the high ranked artist in the age group of 15-20 played most are generally cross genres, while in the age group of 25-30, the high ranked artist are more focus on a single genre.\n\n# Read the data\ndf_sound_info = pd.read_csv('../data/01-modified-data/last.fm.data/last_fm_track_info.csv')\n\n\n# merge the dataset\n\ndf_listen_sound = df_listen_info.merge(df_sound_info, how='left', left_on='track_id', right_on='track_id')\n\n\n# Drop the missing value\ndf_listen_sound.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n\ndf_listen_sound.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_id\ntrack_id\nalbum_id\ntimestamp\ncountry\nage\ngender\ncreation_time\ndanceability\nenergy\nkey\nloudness\nmode\nspeechiness\nacousticness\ninstrumentalness\nliveness\nvalence\ntempo\nid\n\n\n\n\n1\n4462\n41878638\n10034639\n2020-01-10 04:40:28\nCL\n25-30\nm\n2006-03-21 17:47:37\n0.415\n0.104\n0.0\n-11.830\n1.0\n0.0426\n0.955000\n0.000004\n0.1040\n0.180\n82.006\n4g2WiijzSKzH8PApKDbadN\n\n\n2\n43790\n38231384\n9469808\n2020-02-26 22:33:45\nIT\n15-20\nm\n2010-01-07 21:10:59\n0.708\n0.384\n5.0\n-12.427\n1.0\n0.0302\n0.089300\n0.841000\n0.0961\n0.691\n87.961\n488u1IbVEsaC7fxjABWjHx\n\n\n5\n51493\n43590126\n444628\n2020-01-23 10:15:28\nUK\n20-25\nm\n2010-07-21 11:40:40\n0.486\n0.617\n5.0\n-7.115\n0.0\n0.0287\n0.095400\n0.000003\n0.1090\n0.417\n138.015\n1mea3bSkSGXuIRvnydlB5b\n\n\n13\n2194\n41200695\n19859102\n2020-03-09 19:06:27\nUK\n20-25\nm\n2005-08-22 06:45:25\n0.566\n0.869\n2.0\n-6.084\n1.0\n0.1000\n0.000916\n0.003460\n0.1140\n0.647\n178.113\n3C84jaEdYxiq8LC4jwYqj6\n\n\n21\n659\n6989555\n5566359\n2020-01-20 20:07:24\nDE\n20-25\nm\n2004-12-27 21:33:40\n0.376\n0.982\n5.0\n-3.779\n0.0\n0.0625\n0.000057\n0.000005\n0.1600\n0.150\n148.926\n6REc2Tq4G2RW5zKXtusTLF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_listen_sound = df_listen_sound[(df_listen_sound['age'] == '15-20') | (df_listen_sound['age'] == '20-25') | (df_listen_sound['age'] == '25-30')]\n\n\nsns.violinplot(data=df_listen_sound, x=\"age\", y=\"tempo\")\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='age', ylabel='tempo'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.violinplot(data=df_listen_sound, x=\"age\", y=\"danceability\")\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='age', ylabel='danceability'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the previous two plots reveals insights into the preferences for danceability and energy across different age groups. For both features, the distributions for the age groups 25-30 and 20-25 exhibit similar shapes, suggesting comparable musical tastes within these age brackets. Conversely, the 15-20 age group displays a distinct pattern, characterized by a bimodal distribution with two clear peaks. This bimodality indicates diverse listening habits within this younger age bracket. Additionally, the median for the 15-20 age group is noticeably lower. A possible explanation for this deviation could be a subset of listeners in this age group who have a preference for tracks with characteristics akin to white noise which has 0 tempo and 0 danceability.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, in this EDA process, we can gain following insight:\n\nPop music is still the king in the music, but it is losing its popularity. Hip hop is becoming more and more popular and also new genres are raising fast in the recent years.\nInstead of going more homogeneous, the popular songs are becoming more diverse in terms of some musical features include tempo and energy.\nThe tempo and energy in the popular songs are decreasing over time, while danceability is more and more popular.\nCompare with the popular songs in the streaming service, platform like tik tok prefers more energetic and danceable songs.\nThe features most positively realted to popularity is loudness, energy and explicit. The features most negatively related to popularity is acousticness and instrumentalness.\nThough energy is decreasing over time in popular songs, it is still higher than the median of overall songs. However, the gap is narrowing over time quickly.\n20-25 years old people is the age group has greatest number in streaming services, following by 15-20 years old and 25-30 years old.\nThere exist a serious unbanalce in gender of the users in streaming music services.\nPeople did not discolse their gender tend to have less listening events.\nThe music taste in different year group is noticable, even 15-20 and 20-25 has different top artist. Also, the music feature they prefer is slightly different too.\n\n\n\nBase on these conclusion from priliminary EDA, we can now refiend our hypothesis and research questions in the following way:\n\nAs the generation Z is becoming the main force of the music consumer, the music is becoming more diverse and less energetic while more danceable.\nThis could also lead to the decline of the popularity of pop music or other classic genres, instead, new genres which fuse those genres before are emerging and taking the market fast.\nGen Z will be more preferring to newer famous artists, and they are more open to music globalizaiton.\nPlatform like tik tok will be promoting more energetic and danceable songs in the future.\nIn the new generation, listeners could be clustered into more groups than before for haveing differnet music taste.\n\nIt is sure that more analysis need to be conduct after this EDA process."

    "section": "Background: Research Works Done in this Field",
    "text": "Background: Research Works Done in this Field\nSince the great changes in musical industry, extensive researches were done in this realm, offering us the background knowledge and valuable insights. I shall address two important publications here which provide us important background knowledge and insight on understanding today’s music trend.\n\nPublication-1: Changing Their Tune: How Consumers’ Adoption of Online Streaming Affects Music Consumption and Discovery\nThis paper throughly described how the streaming service impact the way music were consumed and user behavior. The author segment the research into three parts, first they identify the increment contribution of streaming service is contributing to the overall music consumption. Secondly, it compare the diversity in the consumers’ choice in music categories between streaming service and traditional ownership model. Finally, it researched what could impact a song’s success in the streaming environment (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018).\nTo analysis the effects of adopting streaming service on individual music consumption, they use an anonymous third party service tracking the consumer’s platform preference and their listening behavior to create a panel of data. By applying a difference in differences (DiD) method, the authors compare the consumption differences between the group of people who adopt the streaming service and people who did not. According to their findings, adopting to streaming lead to a 49% increase of music consumption across all the platform. Furthermore listeners in streaming service tend to have a wider spectrum of music choices. The author noted it is benefit to those smaller artist to get attention but it also make the situation more competitive since the listeners now tend to discover new music instead of staying still (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018).\n\n\nPublication-2: Tastes and Age: A Study of the Relationship between Music Tastes and Age Cohorts\nIn this paper, the author tried to investigate the impact of ages’ influence on individual music preference. The main object is to discover the relationship between then contemporary music taste and age age cohorts (Glevarec, Nowak, and Mahut 2020). The data they used for research is the ELIPSS inquiry from 2013 conducted by the Centre of Socio-Political Data in Pairs. This enquires include 13 genres of music and with a sample space of 892. The research methodology employed a regression analysis on the socio-demographic variables including age, education, profession, gender of a person and their taste of music genres. The finding reveal that for most music genres, age of the listener is the dominate factor to determine whether it will be appreciate or not. It is also noticed that people tend to rate the artist higher when they are at a similar age with the listener. Also, the author went further and point out it can be inferred from the research that people are likely to be linked to an artist they encountered during their teenager (Glevarec, Nowak, and Mahut 2020).\n\n\nOther Relevent Works:\nThere are many other researches dive into the topic of the contemporary music trends in many perspective to provide us the background of this project. The trend can be split into three aspect, the trend for music content, the trend in music consumption and the trend in music creation.\n\nTrend in Music Contents:\nIn terms of music content, current researches indicating the lyric of the songs are getting simpler and the songs with simple lyrics tend to be more successful (Varnum et al. 2021). Also, according to research, the lyrics now more likely to contain negative emotions (Brand, Acerbi, and Mesoudi 2019). This is important to notice since the research done by Borg and Hokkanen shows that lyrics plays an significant role in a music’s success (Borg and Hokkanen 2011). There are also new genres emerging, Base on the second publication summary above, we can observe the new Z generation is the key audience of those novice genres (Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg 2018). According to Klement & Strambach, the local and extra-local knowledge source contribute to those new genres creation (Klement and Strambach 2019).\n\n\nTrend in Music Consumption:\nThe advent of streaming services has totally revolutionized music consumption as describe in the first publication’s summary. Additionally, changes also reflect on the form music been consumed. Nowadays music is often consume in combine with video or games. An good example is the TikTok. According to study, the more interactive mode in platform like TikTok short video make people foster affliction by mixing the music with image, video and text, and it is also shown as a way to self-express and connect people with similar afflictions (Vizcaı́no-Verdú and Abidin 2022).\n\n\nTrend in Music Creation:\nThere are also revolution in music creations. With more AI assistance tools emerging, even individual without traditional musical training could create songs, however it also means the standard for hit song is increasing (Liu 2019). Also the streaming service like Spotify enable artist to upload their work without the need of signing to a label. However, these technology doesn’t always promote the creation. THOMAS HODGSON described it as ‘Creative Ambivalence’ mainly caused by the opaque nature of recommending algorithm (Hodgson 2021). Artist might spend more time to align their work to the algorithm rather than being creative (Hodgson 2021)."

We hypothesize that the as the Generation Z becoming the main consumer, there would be significant changes regarding the genre, rhythm and lyric of trending music. We also expect to see a trend where individual artist and artists who also from Gen Z are thriving."
